# Value Head Output Audit

- **Date:** 2025-10-06T16:22:00Z
- **Inspector:** Automated agent
- **Scope:** Distributional value head in `custom_policy_patch1.py`

## Findings

- The value function is implemented as a categorical distribution whose atoms are initialized over a finite support `[v_min, v_max]` (default `[-1, 1]`).
- During training, the support is dynamically updated to the observed return range by `DistributionalPPO.update_atoms`, keeping the logits constrained to this bounded support.
- Therefore, the value head output remains bounded without additional tanh scaling.

## Verdict

- **Status:** PASS â€” Value distribution uses fixed (albeit dynamically adjusted) bounded support.
